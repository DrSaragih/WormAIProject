qa_pairs = {
    "What is vermicomposting?": "Vermicomposting is a method of composting using worms (usually red wigglers or Eisenia fetida) to break down organic materials like kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich compost.",
    "How do worms affect pH in compost?": "Worms help maintain a neutral pH in compost by consuming acidic and basic materials, and their digestive process balances the pH level as they break down organic matter.",
    "What is the ideal pH range for vermicomposting?": "The ideal pH range for vermicomposting is slightly acidic to neutral, typically between 6.0 and 7.0. This range supports the activity of composting worms and encourages decomposition of organic matter.",
    "How can farmers monitor pH in their worm compost?": "Farmers can monitor pH using pH testing kits designed for soil or compost. They can take samples from different parts of the compost pile and test them regularly to ensure pH remains within the optimal range.",
    "What materials can be added to adjust pH in worm compost?": "To adjust pH in worm compost, farmers can add materials such as crushed eggshells (for alkaline adjustment) or citrus peels (for acidic adjustment). These materials can be added in moderation to maintain a balanced pH level.",
    "What should farmers avoid adding to worm compost to maintain pH balance?": "Farmers should avoid adding materials that are extremely acidic or alkaline, such as large amounts of citrus fruits or ashes, as these can disrupt the pH balance and affect the worms' health.",
    "How often should worm compost be turned to manage pH?": "Turning the compost pile regularly (every 1-2 weeks) helps distribute materials evenly and aerates the compost, which can help regulate pH levels naturally by preventing pockets of acidity or alkalinity from forming.",
    "Can vermicompost pH affect plant growth?": "Yes, pH levels in vermicompost can impact plant growth. Plants have specific pH preferences, and maintaining an optimal pH range in vermicompost ensures that the nutrients released during decomposition are readily available to plants without causing nutrient imbalances or deficiencies.",
    "How long does it take for worms to create compost?": "Under optimal conditions, worms can turn organic waste into compost in as little as 1-3 months. Regular feeding, proper moisture levels, and maintaining an optimal temperature (around 55-77Â°F or 13-25Â°C) accelerate the composting process.",
    "What are the benefits of using worm compost for farming?": "Worm compost enriches soil with essential nutrients, improves soil structure and water retention, enhances microbial activity, suppresses plant diseases, and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers, making it an environmentally friendly and sustainable option for farmers."
